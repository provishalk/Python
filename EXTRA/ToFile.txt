You should immediatrly notice that we import another handy command named exists. This returns true
if a file exists, based on its name in string as an argument. It return False if not. We'll be using this function
in the second half of this book to do lots of things, bt right now you shoud see how you can import it.
Using import is a way to get tons of free code other better(well, usually) programmers have written so
you do not ave to write it.
